# 🎮 Gaming Website

A modern, animated gaming website built using **Vite**, **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, **GSAP**, and **Node.js** — inspired by [Zentry](https://zentry.com/).  
This project captures the immersive feel of Zentry’s design while adding custom animations, smooth transitions, and enhanced interactivity.
